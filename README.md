# This version
Since I published this program in a hurry, 
I have not been able to create the application version (for MacOS, maybe Windows too) and dependencies file of the program yet.
If a few requests come in, I'll do it.
Its only Python file for now. Sorry :)
# About app
This app uses Open3D to convert images to 3D models. Its main purpose is being user-frienly GUI. 
It can transform any image into 3D with just one button!
# Updates & Version
I will make a dependencies file very soon, cause program requires a lot of libraries.
I will make a DMG of app soon, so it will be an MacOS app directly, no need to Python.
Maybe i made an EXE too if needed.
You can tell me issues or requests, if this program help some people, i will fix errors or make requests.
# More info about MacOS & Windows app
Like i said in Updates & Version section, i will also make this program a MacOS app.
If many people need Windows app, i will do it too.
Its only Python file for now.
# More info about Updates
Program itself is working nice now. But it needs a lot of libraries.
Therefore, i will make an dependencies file soon. And it will be easy to setup.
